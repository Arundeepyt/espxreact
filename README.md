# espxreact

This project demonstrates the use of **React with ES6 module imports and exports**. It was created using **CodeSandbox** and later pushed to GitHub for internship submission.

## Objective

The main aim of this project is to:

- Practice the structure and setup of a basic React application using ES6 module syntax.
- Understand how to use `import` and `export` for component organization.
- Render components using `ReactDOM.createRoot()` method in a clean and modular format.

## Technologies Used

- React (with Functional Components)
- JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
- HTML
- CodeSandbox for development
- GitHub for version control and sharing

## Files Included

- `App.js` – Contains the main component logic.
- `index.js` – Entry point rendering the `App` component using `ReactDOM.createRoot`.
- `styles.css` – Basic styling (if any).
- `index.html` – HTML structure for mounting the React app.
- `ss.jpg` – Screenshot image of the live working app.
- `.eslintrc.json`, `.gitignore`, and other config files.

## Issue Faced

Due to some **display or rendering issues in CodeSandbox**, the actual preview was **not visible properly** in the online IDE for final internship proof. Hence, the **screenshot `ss.jpg` was added** to this repository as proof of the working application.

## Screenshot Preview

Below is the actual output of the React app (included as `ss.jpg` in the repo):

![Math Function Output Screenshot](./ss.jpg)

The output includes:
- A heading "Math Functions"
- Simple rendered arithmetic expressions such as `5 + 3 = 8` and `5 - 3 = 2`
